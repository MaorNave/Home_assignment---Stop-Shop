Scenario - Analyze visitation patterns at Stop & Shop @ 2335 Dixwell Ave Hamden CT 
Data Sample (on Data folder)
1.	Venue Visits - raw visits (March 1st, 2019 - August 31st, 2019). 
Each record represents a device visit to the venue. 
2.	Devices Daily Activity - device (user) activeness per day; a record per device per day in the sample (i.e. for the devices appearing in the Venue Visits file). 
Coverage varies from 0 [no coverage at all that day] to 1 [full coverage] 
Required Delivery - share Google Drive folder with the following items:
●	A customer-facing Google Slides deck which outlines your findings and insights you would add to them. Note: You will be evaluated on the packaging (look and feel). 
●	Python file with the script you used to analyze the data and generate the results (preferably Google Colab notebook, but any other type works i.e. jupyter notebook/py file)
●	Google Spreadsheet file you used for visualizing the results and preparing the graphs, in case you used one
Guidelines
●	Use Python to calculate the numbers
●	NO NEED to generate the visualizations/graphs using Python (only if it’s easier for you)
●	Use Google Spreadsheets to generate the graphs once you have the numbers on hand (or any other visualization tool if easier for you). 
●	Tip: You can use Kepler.gl in order to generate heatmap if needed
